# Used to deploy a local version of FUSE to Cloud Foundry for manual testing purposes.
# We use the Pivotal Web Services implementation of Cloud Foundry, which has a web UI at
# https://console.run.pivotal.io/organizations/8d015cf8-216f-40fc-9257-50aa9c1b6307

# To use this manifest, the CF CLI must be installed: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html
# You must also ask an admin to invite you to the FUSE organization on Pivotal Web Services.

# To use CLI commands, first run `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`.
# To deploy your local code using this manifest, run the following from the project directory:
# mvn clean package -DskipTests && cf push -f manifest-local.yml
# Logs can be viewed on the web UI or with `cf logs fuse-rest-local-myname`.

# Note that if any part of the app configuration (such as env vars) is changed, the app will usually
# need to be restaged after the changes are pushed in order for those changes to take effect.
# Restaging can be done via `cf restage my-app-name` or on the web UI.

# Delete your app instance from Cloud Foundry when finished with testing to reduce clutter:
# cf delete -r fuse-rest-local-myname
# This is also be useful before a cf push to ensure a clean app deployment.
